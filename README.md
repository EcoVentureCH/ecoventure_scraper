# Scraper (OLD - TO BE MOVED)

A scraper that runs in an interval and saves everything in a global csv named projects.csv. in scraper_definitions.py every function that is defined will be run as a scraper. For now there is conda() and seedrs().

## Usage
run the scraper every 10 minutes -> it generates projects.csv
```console
./scraper.py start 600
```
stop the scraper
```console
./scraper.py stop
```
Initially no project gets published! To publish it we first need to list all projects that were scraped
```console
./scraper.py list
```
and then select projects number 0, 1, 2 and 6 for example to add with
```console
./scraper.py add 0 1 2 6
```
To finally make all additions and removals public
```console
./scraper.py publish
```
To remove a projects that are public
```console
./scraper.py remove 0 2
./scraper.py publish
./scraper.py list
```
To add then remove all projects
```console
./scraper.py add --all
./scraper.py publish
./scraper.py remove -all
./scraper.py publish
```
